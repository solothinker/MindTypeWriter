# MindTypeWriter
MindTypeWriter is a BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) Keyboard that uses the NextMind BCI Kit and Unity game developer platform. It simulates keystrokes to provide keyboard input to Windows platforms, allowing users to control the environment using NextMind's NeuroTags.

MindTypeWriter is a proof-of-concept (POC) designed to develop basic interaction between the Windows operating system and the human mind. It is currently in its initial stages (Gen-I) and requires further iteration to optimize user response.The specifications of the MindTypeWriter is as follows.

- Default screen size is 800x600.
